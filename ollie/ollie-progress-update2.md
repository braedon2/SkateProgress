# Ollie Progress Update 2 (June 28, 2020)

After practicing the trick while not moving for a while I decided to move on to 
doing it in motion. This decision came after reading forums that said once 
you can do it while moving it's easy do to standing but not the other way
around.

My first time practicing the trick while moving mostly consisted of just trying
to pop the board up. If you replay the following gif one hundred times, that's 
pretty much how the session went

## Finding a place to practice as a noobie

Now that I'm back in montreal I've had a harder time finding somwhere to practice.
First I tried some parking lots near Beaver lake but it's summer time and they're
busy pretty much all the time.

I tried the [Verdun skatepark](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Verdun+Skatepark/@45.4649418,-73.562221,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x420e0b96d2ac186a!8m2!3d45.4649418!4d-73.562221)
but as a noobie there is way too much going on. Trying to do the trick is hard enough 
but at the park you're also trying not to get in other people's way or run into someone.
My solution was to find a nice big empty parking lot in the Mile End area.
