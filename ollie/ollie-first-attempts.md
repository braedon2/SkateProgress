# First Attemps At An Ollie

This month (June 2020) I decided I would learn how to ollie on a skateboard. I've been comfortable 
cruising around on different boards for several years but have only learned simple tricks like a manual
and a caveman. I have a lot of free time during the pandemic and this is the hobby I've chosen to 
develop.

## How To Ollie

I've been using [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Wd5_VC5U0I&feature=youtu.be) to learn the trick.
After watching it many times this is how I would summarize how to do an ollie:

1. Place your back toe on the back tail of the board (the part that curves upward) and place your
   front foot somewhere in the middle of the board so that it feels comfortable
2. Crouch down and begin to jump
3. When the legs near extension, begin to raise the front foot and flick the back heel down
4. Continue raising the front foot and allow to board to become almost vertical
5. Push your front foot forward (allowing it to slide up the board) while raising the back leg
6. Land

## Breakdown Of An Almost Succesful Attempt

This section will breakdown one of the more succesful attemps that I caught on video during a 
practice session. First I will show the full attempt, then I will use slowed down versions
to break down what I did right and what I did wrong.

Here's the full version
